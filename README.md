# Abstacle-Avoiding-Robot
This is a Raspberry Piâ€“powered obstacle-avoiding robot designed to improve real-time navigation using sensors, wireless control, and future cybersecurity integration. The project focuses on building a smarter prototype that demonstrates how robotics can influence real-world systems like self-driving cars.

Over the course of a 5-day robotics camp, I learned how to:

  1) Build circuits from scratch using breadboards, resistors, LEDs, buttons, potentiometers, RGB lights, and light sensors

  2) Control outputs like LED lights and speakers through basic input triggers and variable controls

  3) Use Python on Raspberry Pi to program behavior and understand how to run different scripts through a versatile code editor

  4) Work with Raspberry Pi instead of Arduino to power the robot, giving it computing abilities like Wi-Fi connection and future compatibility with Bluetooth and cloud-          based systems

  5) Design and 3D print custom parts, including a robot nameplate, using digital calipers to make accurate real-world models

  6) Assemble a full robot, step by step:

    Mounted motors and wheels

    Installed an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection

    Secured the Raspberry Pi on elevation spacers

    Wired the motor driver board and connected the power system

    Integrated a wireless component to make the robot untethered

By the end of the camp, I had a functioning robot with core obstacle-avoidance behavior and room for future upgrades in sensing, navigation logic, and security.
